1. if you have tags selected in both step 3 and step 4. A card would finally be unsuspended if it contains both tags selected in step 3 and 4.
2. It's normal that you find an unsuspended card, while having a memory of having suspended it through this add-on. That's because a card could have multiple tags, it contains the tag you specified unsuspend.
